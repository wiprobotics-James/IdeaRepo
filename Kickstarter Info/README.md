Subtitle: Use built in motor controllers and Bluetooth to create anything from an RC car to an AI robot. The limit is your imagination.

The Product
The Venom Motor Controller (VMC) is the perfect board to get familiar with Robotics and Electronics. 
This versatile microcontroller is equipped with the well-known atmega328p  and the common CH340G Serial Chip.
VMC has 2 built-in motor controllers , a built-in buzzer, a servo port and a bluetooth port. 
Allowing you to easily downsize RC and robotic projects. This board will provide you a path into robotics and allow you to progress to more advanced practices.

The current version is powered by an atmega328p.

 FLEXIBLE CODE 
All our development boards will include detailed instructions on how to use them along with code examples and occasionally 3D files for making project housing.

 DEVELOPMENT BOARDS AND SHIELDS 
Venom Robotics is currently developing our first development board that will be launched via kickstarter. We have 3 projects in development , more information will be available after the kickstarter campaign.

 COMMUNITY BUILDING 
We will be hosting a range of competitons and surveys after our kickstarter launch. This will give you the chance to help us shape and build our product to benefit you.

 EDUCATION AND INNOVATION 
Venom Robotics will be developing lesson plans and project kits to help schools and businesses teach robotics. An Introduction To Robotics Book will be written to accompany the controller (see stretch goals).

The main challenges of this project is:
Successfully creating the Final version, we have it all designed but it needs to be manufactured and tested before release. This can take a couple weeks to a couple months, depending on any issues we face. The main issue with this process will be the shipping time and cost so we have added a buffer to ensure this is covered.

Another challenge is shipping to customers, if we get alot of funding and we get overwhelmed then shipping times will naturally increase. 

All of these challenges will become a risk for us and you unless we are as transparent as possible. we aim to give weekly updates during and after the campaign. we will also consider opening a discord server so you can talk to us directly and talk to other supporters. Keep an eye on this section as we may update it going forward.
